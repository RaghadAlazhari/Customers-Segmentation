## Customer Segmentation - Clustering

### Overview  
This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The dataset contains information about customers, such as their spending behavior and income, to classify them into distinct groups.

### Dataset  
- The dataset includes customer attributes like **age, gender, annual income, and spending score**.  
- The goal is to group similar customers based on these features for better marketing strategies.

### Steps Taken  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for missing values and handled any inconsistencies.  
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of customer attributes.  
   - Used visualizations like histograms and scatter plots to identify patterns.  

2. **Feature Selection & Scaling**  
   - Selected relevant features (e.g., **annual income and spending score**) for clustering.  
   - Standardized data to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering algorithm.  

3. **Clustering Techniques**  
   - Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on similarity.  
   - Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
   - Visualized the clusters using scatter plots for better interpretation.  

4. **Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Identified different customer groups, such as **high spenders with high income, low spenders with high income, and budget-conscious shoppers**.  
   - Provided insights on how businesses can tailor marketing strategies for each segment.  

### Conclusion  
- The clustering model successfully segmented customers into meaningful groups.  
- Businesses can use these insights for **targeted marketing, personalized promotions, and improved customer engagement**.
